      <h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
      <p>Margem Techno is committed to making its content and experiences accessible to all individuals, regardless of ability, background, or access needs. As a community built around sharing music, culture, and events, we believe that accessibility is essential for true inclusion within the techno scene.</p>

      <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
      <p>We are working continuously to improve the usability of our website, videos, photo galleries, and event experiences. Our platform is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that people using assistive technologies can navigate, engage with, and enjoy the content we publish.</p>

      <h3>Digital Accessibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Text alternatives (alt text) for all visual media</li>
        <li>Keyboard-accessible navigation and controls</li>
        <li>High contrast text and scalable typography</li>
        <li>Captions and descriptions for selected video content</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physical Events</h3>
      <p>As we begin hosting our own parties and events, we aim to select venues that are physically accessible, and to clearly communicate access features in advance. We also welcome feedback from our community to help shape inclusive and respectful dancefloors.</p>

      <h3>Get in Touch</h3>
      <p>If you experience any issues accessing our platform or events, or if you have suggestions to improve accessibility, please contact us at <a href="mailto:margem.techno@gmail.com">margem.techno@gmail.com</a>. We are always open to learning and improving.</p>
